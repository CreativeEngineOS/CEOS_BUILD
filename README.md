**CEOS_BUILD Blueprint**

  Welcome to the blueprint of CEOS_BUILD, an open-source intended "scaffolding" system and 
  underlying logic developed for creatives who want to reclaim control over their workflows. 
  This project is my response to years of frustration with scattered tools and a desire to 
  build a system that is transparent, efficient, and human-centric.

**Our Mission**

  The core focus of CEOS_BUILD is to:
  Streamline Production: Create efficient pipelines for both commissioned and independent creative projects. 
  Enhance Interaction: Drive UI/UX logic based on direct interaction between the producer, client, and end-user.
  Counter the Ad Hoc: Provide a structured, repeatable, and self-sufficient guideline that counters the unstructured 
  and ad hoc workflows prevalent in the creative industry.
  Champion Transparency: Offer a transparent, "open-source" system that serves as a counterweight to AI and LLMs.

**Current Status**

  The project is currently in the rough-design, test, and implementation phase. The file and document tree 
  structures are growing organically, and archival databases are being primed for ingestion into the overall system. 
  I'm building this system from the ground up, inspired by the open-source community and a "tinker-first, polish-later" approach.

**The CEOS_BUILD Toolbox**

  The home-base for this project is this GitHub repository, with a GitHub Pages website to showcase the system tree. 

Development & Deployment Stages:

    01 - CEOS_BUILD Source & Project Files: Hosted on GitHub (PHP/HTML/Python).
    02 - Offline Sandbox Server: A local environment for testing SQL, PHP, and Python tools.
    03 - Online Server: For SQL/PHP/HTML rendering, Streamlit.io (Python web-apps), and Google App Scripts.
    04 - Outputs: Live URLs where the system is implemented (e.g., https://oogimages.com, https://bastiaanslabbers.com/labs/).
    05 - Wordpress Updates: The public-facing News & Updates platform.


**Core Concepts: The Production Philosophy**

  The production pipelines are built on a set of core concepts that ensure structure, room for inspiration, and a continuous feedback loop.

01 - Project Slug: 
      Each project receives a unique slug (e.g., yyyymmdd-short-description-ID).
      This slug is reflected in the project's root folder, file metadata, and filenames. This ensures consistency from the very beginning.

02 - Ingest to Output Pipeline: 
      A standardized file structure visualizes the state of every project:

      00 - >_ARCHIVES          Final destination for all fully developed content.
      01 - >_INCOMING          Initial ingestion point for all raw data.
      02 - >_SELECTS           Work files culled to move forward in the pipeline.
      03 - >_PROJECT FILES     WIP documents in their layered, uncompressed state.
      04 - >_OUTPUTS           Final deliverables at full size/resolution.
      05 - >_SHARE             Deliverables adapted for public sharing.

03 - CEOS System Structure: 
      The core directory structure that acts as the system's root:

      >_DASHBOARD              The system root.
      >_LABS                   My experimental playground for shaping and testing new ideas and tools.
      >_CORE                   The under-the-hood systems for my services, pricing, and policies.
      >_CREATIVE ENGINE        Where the live work happens, showcasing projects in photography, video, and audio.
      >_LIBRARY                The curated archives of past work and legacy projects.
      <_FEEDBACK               The contact and feedback hub for all external communication.


**Join the Journey**

This project is an evolving system, and I believe in open collaboration. I’m a builder of systems, not just a creator of content, and my goal is to build a sustainable workflow that can be a blueprint for others. I am a developer at heart, but from a creative’s perspective, not a code-first person.
